# cord_strbuf_t should take in an allocator instead of using malloc/free

# Move all malloc/frees to corresponding allocators
Watchers, temporary variables, etc. GREP for malloc/free calls

# Reconnect code does not take into account anything other than websocket clinet and heartbeat timer
Destroy only what's hb watcher / ws client and when reinitialize only those.
