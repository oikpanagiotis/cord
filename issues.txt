Issues
-------

-- High --
* Refactor object serialization implementation
We should be able to serialize discord json objects into 
structs. We can do it in one of two ways:
1. Have each field be a pointer so we can use NULL as non-existing value
2. Create wrapper type cord_optional_t{type, value, exists}


-- Medium --
* Write json utility functions
We should create some more abstract functions for handling JSON with jansson
library and test them througly for memory leaks. Additionally we should
set the default allocator to be used by the library to a "permanent"
bump allocator.


-- Medium --
* Print backtrace on crash while in debug mode
We should print a stacktrace if we crash while in debug mode so we
can identify what caused it. This must only be used under GCC


-- Low --
* Implement Discord's REST APIs
We should implement all the REST APIs in discord 


-- Low --
* Abstract web socket operations
We should abstract web socket structures and functions into our own
so we can easily swap the implementation in the future
